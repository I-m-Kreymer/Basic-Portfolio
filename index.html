						<p class="p_about">
							<span class="Capital_Letter">W</span>hat is it about balance that drives us to seek it. Whether it's at work, in our relationships or anywhere else, people always say that having the right balance is important. Even as I write this I am thinking about how to best balance a full time job, a coding bootcamp, and my personal life, while still having time to sit and think outside of those items. 
							<br>
							<br>
							As confounding as balance is to me, the idea that once balance is achieved, a feeling of unease follows. This feeling pushes me to get out of my comfort zone and push to try to learn something else. 
							<br>
							<br>
							That's the short and really backwards way of what got me into coding.
